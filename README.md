# Four-Skillful-Sisters-Prototype
Mock prototype of a computer game

This is a class project where the assignment was to create a mock prototype for a computer game/video game.  Each prototype was supposed to be based on a Brothers Grimm fairytale. I chose the fairy tale "The Four Skillful Brothers" for my project.
